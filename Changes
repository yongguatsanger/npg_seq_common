LIST OF CHANGES

release 50.12
  - seqchksum_merge.pl
      updated to generate chksums on the fly is given a bam file
      added new column class (partition) to partition data when merging.
      modified and extended tests. N.B. running the script on multiple bam files 
      should generate the same values as bamcat + bamseqchksum but the
      order is no longer guaranteed to be the same
  - RefMaker: added extra dict symlink for RNA SeQc
  - code changes to reduce number of warnings under Perl 5.22.2
  
release 50.11
  - RefMaker: added function for longranger mkref and extended test

release 50.10
  - RefMaker: generate blat 2bit genome references
  - bam_alignment.pl: enforce to have id_run and position defined. It's
    needed to create an old-style bamflagstats autoqc result object, see
    https://github.com/wtsi-npg/npg_qc/pull/342.

release 50.9
  - fix bug that causes the symlink of the .fa file in the bowtie2
    directory to point to the wrong location

release 50.8
  - replace bamcheck file by 2x filtered samtools stats files

release 50.7
  - bam alignment:
      remove redundant not_strip_bam_tag flag
      remove do_markduplicates flag and always call mark duplicates
  - bam mark duplicates:
      drop replace_file flag, always run file moves
      derive metrics_file attribute from teh output file name and then rename the file
      to be forward compatible with pending changes in bam_flagstats, call bam_flagstats
        parser via top-level execute() method ot be forward compatible
      bam_flagstats check is serialized in the same way as it is done in post-p4 flow

release 50.6
  - mark duplicates:
      - tag stripper is not used any longer - remove code and
        remove option
      - stop using Picard estimate library complexity since
        it is not used in p4 flows, remove option
      - do not check paths of live tools in tests
      - subset attribute replaces human_split
      - drop sort_input option since input is always gets sorted
  - seq alignment:
      - remove dependency on the autoqc wrapper object
      - drop not_strip_bam_tag, no_estimate_library_complexity and
        sort_input command line options when calling duplicates
        marking script
      - use subset option instead of human_split option when calling
        duplicates marking split

release 50.5
  - removed unused modules and scripts
  - use 'subset' option when creating bam_flagstats result object

release 50.4
  - Ref maker - stop supporting gcbias check, ie do not run gcn_maker

release 49.10
  - BAM_Alignment.pm pass a reference to the phix markduplicates command

    but no reference was defined. For phix no reference was passed to the
    markduplicates command so no cram files were created.

release 49.9
  - reference added to bamseqchecksum in BAM_MarkDuplicate for aligned data
  - new test bam added for aligned data for correct CRAM file generation

release 49.8

    md5sum and bamseqchksums generated with all crams
  - un-aligned subset bam added to test data

  - copyright for all modules and script belongs to GRL - the copyright
    notice edited where it was incorrect

release 49.3
