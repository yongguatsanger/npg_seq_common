./Build
./Build installdeps --cpan_client 'cpan -i' #to install cpan dependencies, ensure cpan was built with the perl you are using for this build
./Build test
./Build install

It is expected that third party executables are found on the path. Java jar files are expected to be found in a directory pointed by the CLASSPATH envronment variable.
